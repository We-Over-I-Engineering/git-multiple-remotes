# FAQs.

### Can you not rebase instead of merging before you push changes to the startup repository?

You can rebase, but if there are some diverging changes on the `dev` branch of the `startup` repository, you must resolve conflicts at least twice to complete the process. Therefore, the workflow gets a lot more complicated.

### Do these guides cover all the cases?

No, they try to cover the frequent cases, but the idea behind them is to help you create a mental model of the workflow. While I expect most situations to fall within the mentioned cases, there may be instances where you have to improvise depending on your particular situation.
